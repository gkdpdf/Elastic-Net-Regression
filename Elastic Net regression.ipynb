    "Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression model that combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques. It addresses the limitations of each by adding both penalties to the linear regression cost function. This helps prevent overfitting, handles multicollinearity, and performs variable selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences from other regression techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression: Elastic Net includes L1 regularization like Lasso but mitigates its tendency to select only one variable by adding Ridge regularization. This prevents it from entirely zeroing out less important variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression: Similar to Ridge, Elastic Net includes L2 regularization, which helps in handling multicollinearity. However, Elastic Net introduces the L1 penalty as well, providing a balance for sparse variable selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary Least Squares (OLS): OLS is a standard linear regression without regularization. Elastic Net, with its combined L1 and L2 penalties, is more flexible and robust when dealing with datasets with correlated predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net is particularly useful when facing high-dimensional datasets with multiple correlated features, offering a versatile compromise between the strengths of Lasso and Ridge regression."

    "Interpreting coefficients in Elastic Net Regression can be somewhat challenging due to the combined effects of L1 and L2 regularization. The regularization terms (L1 and L2 penalties) influence the magnitude and sparsity of the coefficients. Here's a general guide:\n",
